### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Rae!

I'm a global business and math student at Fordham. I'm an experimenter at heart: I love trying out new technologies! I started out in Python and use it regularly in my part-time job as a research assistant. I've recently been working on improving my frontend skills with Javascript, specifically React. Check out two of my JS projects:

- [Bento](https://bento.vercel.app), an inventory management app for the Square platform
- [Elementario](https://elementario.vercel.app), a tiny dungeon crawler game

For more of my coding projects and the stories behind them, take a look at my [Devpost](https://devpost.com/rishmael/).

âœ¨ When I'm not coding...
- I'm doing number theory! âš¡ Here's a fun math fact: Add up all the digits in a number. If you can divide their sum by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3! (Try 921: 9 + 2 + 1 = 12, and 12 is divisible by 3, so 921 is also divisible by 3.)
- I'm on the hunt for cool data art. Recently, I went to New York's Data x Design exhibition and loved it. For inspiration, I recommend the book _Data Sketches_ by Nadieh Bremer and Shirley Wu.
- Last but not least, I also love games, especially narrative-driven ones! Talk to me about Supergiant's roguelike game, Hades â€” I'm _so_ excited for Hades II.
